# About

This is the repository for my (@rbrito's) packaging of the beautiful Zukitwo
family of themes for GTK2/3 made by Mattias aka lassekongo83.

It includes the last released version (that I know of) of the Zukitwo-Dark
theme, which I want to preserve as much as possible (even though I don't
know anything about theming GTK2/3 applications for the lack of time).

Since I Mattias doesn't seem to be interested in maintaining Zukitwo-Dark
anymore *and* it is the most professionally and soberly designed dark theme
that I know of, I will try to keep it available as much as I can.

While Matthias has updated Zukitwo for versions of GTK3 later than 3.4, he
dropped Zukitwo-Dark completely from his plans for Zukitwo, which I think is
an unfortunate thing, as I am willing to *pay* to get Zukitwo-Dark ported to
whatever version of GTK 3 is available in Debian.

I am certainly not alone with this, since I have even seen some people in
deviantart asking Matthias things like "how much would you like for bringing
back Zukitwo-Dark?", without any response from him.

Alas, there is hope that, at least, the theme for GTK2 will continue to
work, since all the developent focus is on GTK3 (well, as long as people
don't mess up with backwards compatibility of GTK2).

# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to automate the (boring) manual
instructions of how one might want to install the themes, taking care of all
the dependencies, and also recommending the beautiful Faenza icon theme.
