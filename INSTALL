## USING A TRANSPARENT PANEL BACKGROUND IN GNOME 2 ##

1. Right-click on your panel and select properties.
2. Set the height to 32px and the position to bottom. 
3. Click on the Background tab and select to use a custom background image.
4. Select the panelbg.png included the archive. (panelbg.png)
If the panel didn't become transparent you're using an old version of Gnome, or you are not using the Zukitwo GTK theme.

## USING A CUSTOM PANEL BACKGROUND IN GNOME 3 FALLBACK MODE ##

Due to some complications this is not 100% possible. Only certain parts will use the custom background.

## NOT USING NAUTILUS ELEMENTARY IN GNOME 2.32? ##
(Nautilus is the default file-manager in Gnome. There's a mod for it that makes it look more compact. It's called Nautilus Elementary.)

1. Locate the 'gtkrc' file inside the Zukitwo theme you're using. Open it in a text editor.
2. At the bottom of the file locate nautilus-e.rc and replace it with nautilus.rc.
