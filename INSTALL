############################

To use this theme you'll need the LATEST stable versions of the following software:

- Gnome 2.32 or Gnome 3.4
- The Unico GTK3 engine v1.0.2. (Only needed if you are using GTK3 applications. Google it or search for it on launchpad.net.)
- The Murrine GTK2 engine 0.98.1.1 or later. (Package name varies between distributions. This engine should be installed by default in Ubuntu.)
- The Pixbuf GTK2 engine (Package name varies between distributions. This engine should be installed by default in Ubuntu. In arch, fedora and some other non-debian distributions it's included in the gtk2-engines or gtk-engines package. In Debian based distros it's called gtk2-engines-pixbuf.)
- Nautilus-Elementary (Not needed. But it's recommended if you're using Gnome 2.32.)
- gnome-tweak-tool (If you're using Gnome 3.)
- Gnome-shell-extension-user-theme (To enable 3rd party themes in gnome-shell.)

## INSTALLING THE GTK2 THEME ##

Unzip the included folder(s) to 1 of the following locations:
/usr/share/themes
/home/your username/.themes

Go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance and click on the Customize button.
Select the theme(s) from the lists there.

Note: The /.themes folder is only for your user. If you for example open Synaptic or any other administrative application it will not be styled.

## INSTALLING THE GTK3 & GNOME-SHELL THEME ##

Unzip the included folder(s) to 1 of the following locations:
/usr/share/themes
/home/your username/.themes

Note: The /.themes folder is only for your user. If you for example use an application as root it will not be styled.

Go to System -> Accessories -> Advanced Settings or search for gnome-tweak-tool.
In this app (gnome-tweak-tool) you can select the GTK theme and metacity theme.

To use the GNOME-Shell theme you need to install gnome-shell-extension-user-theme.
This package may or may not be available in your distribution's repository. Otherwise availble here - https://extensions.gnome.org/

If changes doesn't take place after selecting the themes you can try to log out and back in. If you're in Gnome-shell you can just press ALT+F2 and type r to restart the shell.

## USING A TRANSPARENT PANEL BACKGROUND IN GNOME 2 ##

1. Right-click on your panel and select properties.
2. Set the height to 32px and the position to bottom. 
3. Click on the Background tab and select to use a custom background image.
4. Select the panelbg.png included the archive. (panelbg.png)
If the panel didn't become transparent you're using an old version of Gnome, or you are not using the Zukitwo GTK theme.

## USING A CUSTOM PANEL BACKGROUND IN GNOME 3 FALLBACK MODE ##

Due to some complications this is not 100% possible. Only certain parts will use the custom background.

## NOT USING NAUTILUS ELEMENTARY IN GNOME 2.32? ##
(Nautilus is the default file-manager in Gnome. There's a mod for it that makes it look more compact. It's called Nautilus Elementary.)

1. Locate the 'gtkrc' file inside the Zukitwo theme you're using. Open it in a text editor.
2. At the bottom of the file locate nautilus-e.rc and replace it with nautilus.rc.
